    description: |
      Optional GPIO used to wake up the Argos SMD module from low power mode.
      When the module is configured to use low power mode (AT+LPM), use the
      argos_smd_wakeup_enable() function to set this pin high before
      communicating with the module, and argos_smd_wakeup_disable() to set
      it low when done to allow the module to enter low power mode.
      If not specified, no GPIO control is available and the module should be
      managed by external circuitry or kept always awake.
